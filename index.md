# About Me

I am a Post-Doctoral Researcher at the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) at the University of Colorado Boulder. I study climate change with a focus on internal variability and climate signal detection, and my research often takes place at the interface between earth system models and satellite observations. Before working in climate science, I studied physics as an undergraduate student at Carleton College (2014 - 2018) and worked at the National Institute for Standards and Technology (2018 - 2019). I received my PhD in Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences from the University of Colorado in 2025, where I was advised by Professor Jennifer Kay and supported by a [NASA FINESST award](https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/viewrepositorydocument/cmdocumentid=887035/solicitationId=%7B87947100-56AE-C4DC-C511-0349862D658A%7D/viewSolicitationDocument=1/FINESST-21%20Earth%20Science%20Division%20Selections%20June%2030%202022.pdf){:target="_blank"} and the [NASA PREFIRE Mission](https://prefire.ssec.wisc.edu/){:target="_blank"}.

I love learning about our planet and how we observe it. I am especially interested in the radiative impacts of clouds and aerosols, understanding the limitations of satellite observations and climate models, and using weather/climate models as tools for renewable forecasting and operations. My mission as a climate scientist is to work collaboratively to answer questions that inform climate adaptation and mitigation efforts.

*Science is successful when diverse voices are present and valued. As a scientist and a human being, I am committed to dismantling the systems of oppression that permeate academia.*
