# About Me

I am a PhD Candidate in the Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at the University of Colorado Boulder. I study climate change in the Arctic through the lens of global climate models, and my research takes place at the interface between these models and satellite observations. I am advised in my research by Professor Jennifer Kay and am currently funded by a [NASA FINESST award](https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/viewrepositorydocument/cmdocumentid=887035/solicitationId=%7B87947100-56AE-C4DC-C511-0349862D658A%7D/viewSolicitationDocument=1/FINESST-21%20Earth%20Science%20Division%20Selections%20June%2030%202022.pdf){:target="_blank"} and the [NASA PREFIRE Mission](https://prefire.ssec.wisc.edu/){:target="_blank"}.

I love learning about our planet and how we observe it. I am especially interested in the radiative impacts of clouds and aerosols, and understanding the limitations of satellite observations and climate models. In the future, I want to use predictions of climate change and variability to inform climate policy and mitigation.

*Science is successful when diverse voices are present and valued. As a scientist and a human being, I am committed to dismantling the systems of oppression that permeate academia.*
