# Research

Write a brief blurb on all of my current and previous research projects here. I could also do a post for each new article.

#### Projects to list (in chronological order)

*   Comb stabilization w/ Scott Diddams [Versatile digital approach to laser frequency comb stabilization](./assets/pdf/shaw2019_osacontinuum_combstabilization.pdf){:target="_blank"}
*   Mixed-phase clouds w/ Trude Storelvmo [Using Satellite Observations to Evaluate Model Microphysical Representation of Arctic Mixed-Phase Clouds](./assets/pdf/shaw2022_GRL_arcticslf){:target="_blank"}
*   Paleo-climate constraints on climate sensitivity w/ Jiang Zhu [LGM Paleoclimate Constraints Inform Cloud Parameterizations and Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity in CESM2](./assets/pdf/zhu2022_JAMES_paleoconstraints.pdf){:target="_blank"}


*   Ongoing projects with cloud phase (zsm,bruno,hofer)
*   Evaluating cloud fields in models using multiple observational records and satellite simulators w/ Brian Medeiros
