# Research

I love the creative and collaborative nature of climate research. The opportunity to work with scientists across my discipline and across the world is a constant source of excitement and motivation for me. You can find a brief summary of my current, previous, and future work below.

#### Current work

*   The Arctic is warming somewhere between [2 and 4 times the global average](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/11/climate/arctic-global-warming.html). Given this rapid pace of surface change, how is the thermal energy that the Arctic radiates into space changing? Using observations from NASA's CERES mission and the CESM1 Large Ensemble, I am placing observed and predicted changes in Arctic outgoing longwave radiation into the context of internal climate variability. I want to answer the question "have observed changes in Arctic longwave radiation emerged from internal climate variability?". If not, when do we expect emergence to occur?

#### Previous work

*   I led a study that used observations of vertical cloud phase structure in the Arctic to constrain mixed-phase cloud microphysics in the NorESM2 global climate model. The results of this work show that mixed-phase processes mediate the Arctic climate by modifying how wintertime and springtime clouds respond to warming. [*Using Satellite Observations to Evaluate Model Microphysical Representation of Arctic Mixed-Phase Clouds*](./assets/pdf/shaw2022_GRL_arcticslf.pdf){:target="_blank"}
*   I co-authored a study led by Jiang Zhu that used paleo-climate records to re-evaluate cloud parametrizations in the CESM2 global climate model. This study highlights the unique value of paleoclimate constraints in informing the cloud parameterizations and future climate projections. [*LGM Paleoclimate Constraints Inform Cloud Parameterizations and Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity in CESM2*](./assets/pdf/zhu2022_JAMES_paleoconstraints.pdf){:target="_blank"}
*   While working at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, I used low-cost equipment and open-source software to stabilize a laser frequency comb. Our system performs comparably to expensive commercial equipment and can be adapted to other laser frequency combs and continuous-wave lasers, enabling digital phase control in a wide range of settings. This paper was named an Editor's Pick by OSA Continuum.

#### Future work

*   *Simulating spectral longwave radiation in global climate models.* Spectrally-resolved observations of infrared radiation such as those made by NASA’s Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) instrument provide valuable information about the Earth’s climate and energy budget. Yet, spectral observations are rarely used in climate change detection research. One central reason for this omission is that climate models do not produce and save spectral output. Without such model output, it is challenging to compare modeled and observed spectral radiation and to determine if observed spectral changes can be explained by natural variability alone. I am building a tool to simulate spectrally-resolved infrared radiances akin to AIRS observations within climate models. By running simulating AIRS observations in a suite of targeted climate model experiments, I will determine where in the infrared spectrum changes in the Arctic climate are first detected and what climate processes are responsible for these signals. **If you are excited about simulating spectral fields in climate models and are interested in using our data or collaborating, please don't hesitate to reach out!*
