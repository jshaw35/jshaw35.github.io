title: "About Me"
permalink: /about-me

I am a PhD Candidate in the Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences department at the University of Colorado Boulder. I study climate change in the Arctic through the lens of Global Climate Models, and my research takes place at the interface between these models and satellite observations. I am advised in my research by Professor Jennifer Kay.

I love learning about our planet and how we observe it. I am especially interested in the radiative impacts of clouds and aerosols, and understanding the limitations of satellite observations and climate models.

Science is successful when diverse voices are present and valued. As a scientist and a human being, I am committed to dismantling the systems of oppression that permeate academia.
