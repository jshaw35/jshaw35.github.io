# Professional Interests

I work in climate science because the questions we answer are both challenging and societally-relevant. Working in a research/professional community that is friendly and collaborative is also very important to me. Looking to the future, I want my career to inform climate policy and mitigation efforts in addition to answering open questions in the scientific literature.
