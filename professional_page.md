# Professional Interests

I work in climate science because the questions we answer are both challenging and societally-relevant. Working in a research/professional community that is welcoming and collaborative is also very important to me. Looking to the future, I want my career to inform climate policy and mitigation efforts in addition to answering open questions in the scientific literature.


<!-- I support open-source, transparent, and sharable science. [Link to my github account.](https://github.com/jshaw35){:target="_blank"} -->
