# Professional Interests

I work in climate science because the questions we answer are challenging and societally-relevant. Furthermore, the research community is incredibly friendly and intensely collaborative. Looking to the future, I want my work to inform climate policy and mitigation efforts in addition to answering open questions in the scientific literature. I also want my work to be surrounded by colleagues with similar motivation and values.
