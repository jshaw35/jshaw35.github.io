# jshaw35.github.io
personal webpage via github pages

Started 2022/11/01.
Goals:
- Create a publicly accessible site to share my CV/resum√©, research, and perhaps career goals.
- At this point I am not really interested in having personal information accessible in this way, so I will keep the site professionally oriented.
- Aim for a visually pleasing site
- Get some experience with html and jekyll
